A logout process may look like the one displayed in the next image:

Ending the session in the authorization server provider is not standard.

Micronaut provides several beans which are loaded by default.

The authorization server's end session url is provided by an implementation of api:io.micronaut.security.oauth2.openid.endpoints.endsession.EndSessionUrlProvider[]. By default, api:io.micronaut.security.oauth2.openid.endpoints.endsession.DefaultEndSessionUrlProvider[] is used.

Micronaut attempts to create a valid configuration by default but you can always control the end-session endpoint configuration:

However, if the default values do not suffice, you can configure the communication with the authorization endpoint:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.security.oauth2.openid.endpoints.endsession.EndSessionEndpointConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

Several <<providerSpecificBeans, Provider Specific beans>> related to end session endpoint configuration are provided.
