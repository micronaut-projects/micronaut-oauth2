Micronaut integration with authentication & authorization platforms such as https://developer.okta.com[Okta], https://auth0.com[Auth0], https://aws.amazon.com/cognito[AWS Cognito], https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloack], etc.

Once you create an application client with a provider you will get a Client ID and Secret.

The previous image shows how to get an client id and client secret with AWS Cognito. Please, note you can obtain similar credentials with other providers. 

Once, you get the `client_id` and `client_secret`

[source, yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
micronaut:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client-secret: '${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}'
      client-id: '${OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}'
----

Create two environment variables `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` with the credentials you obtained from the provider.
